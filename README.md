# Django-School-Management-System

This app is meant to be used by school manager to manage their school records:
student data
staff
results and
finances.

It currently doesn't allow students/staff to login.
Solely, it's expected to be used on a single machine or online for managers only.

## Usage
It's best to install Python projects in a Virtual Enviroment. Once you have set up a VE, clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adigunsherif/Django-School-Management-System.git
```
Then

```bash
cd newapp
```
Run

```python
python manange.py migrate # run first migration
python manange.py runserver # run the server
```
Then locate http://172.0.0.1:8000

## Roadmap
To build a fully fledge open source school management for administrative use only.
